ü§ñ What is Flashbots?
Overview
Flashbots is a research and development organization focused on solving problems related to Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) on Ethereum. It provides a way for users to send transaction bundles directly to miners (or validators in PoS), bypassing the public mempool.

Key Benefits
Privacy: Transactions sent through Flashbots do not appear in the public mempool, preventing front-running and sandwich attacks.

Efficiency: Allows developers and traders to optimize MEV strategies like arbitrage or liquidation.

Fairness: Facilitates a more transparent and structured relationship between searchers (users) and block producers.

By using Flashbots, developers can create custom transaction strategies and ensure safe, targeted delivery of those transactions.

# Flashbots Transaction Bundle Sender (Goerli Testnet)

This project is a simple Node.js script that sends private transactions using **Flashbots** on the Ethereum Goerli testnet. The goal is to execute transactions in a secure and front-running-free environment, leveraging MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) infrastructure.

## üîç About the Project

This script performs the following steps:

1. Connects to the Goerli testnet using Alchemy.
2. Creates a Flashbots Bundle Provider.
3. Prepares a transaction bundle (with both legacy and EIP-1559 types).
4. Simulates the bundle to ensure it will not fail.
5. Sends the bundle to Flashbots for inclusion in the next 10 blocks.

This approach ensures a high probability that your transaction will be included, even if a Flashbots relay is not immediately selected as the block proposer.
